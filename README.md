# Loan-Default-Prediction
Background

The GE credit department provides credit and financing solutions to its customers.
A loan becomes a problem for the company when clients default or are late on their payments. Until now, GE was approving credit requests based on the applicants financial, socio-demographic data. In order to better assess the risks it faces, the department orders a data analytics initiative to predict loan default before it happens. The goal is to be able to differentiate between good and bad credit applicants.

Methodology

R and Rattle are used to create a Logistic Regression Model that can predict whether an applicant will likely default or not.
The methodology that will be used is the CRISP-DM, a common methodology for a data mining process model. It consists of six stages: (1) business understanding, (2) data understanding, (3) data preparation, (4) modeling, (5) evaluation, and (6) deployment.

Business understanding

-	The problem: Determine which credit application is risky or not.
-	Impact of problem: loan defaults, financial loss for the company
-	Value of data analytics initiative: better understanding of customers, better risk management, limitation of financial losses.
-	Project plan: Timing, resources (data to be collected, personnel to work on project, selection of data analytics tools, techniques, budget), risks and contingencies, cost.


Data understanding

In order to design a good predictive model, the company must be sure of the quality of the data. The dataset contains various socio-demographics and financial data of past customers. 
A first step has been taken by making the data anonymous. The data belong to 1000 past credit applicants (credit history with GE, checking account status, number of credit lines at GE, savings account balance, occupation, age, credit amount requested, properties owned).  


Results
